# Optimizing-RENAULT-CARS-ORDER-with-Simulated-anealing
This project was part of a challenge called "KIRO," conducted in collaboration with Renault, the French car manufacturer. The primary goal was to optimize the sequencing of vehicles between different workshops (e.g., paint, assembly), with a focus on minimizing costs.

We implemented the Simulated Annealing algorithm, which consistently delivered high-quality solutions while requiring minimal in-depth knowledge of the physical details of the problem.

Each run of the algorithm resulted in effective optimizations. The project was developed primarily in Python .
